    <p>In this example, we have two loops. Because there is one loop that is inside the other,<br>
        we call this a nested loop. The first loop is often called an "outer loop", and the second<br>
        is often called the "inner loop" because it is inside the first, outer loop </p>

    <p> The outer loop executes first, and for each time the outer loop is executed, <br>
    the inner loop will also be executed.</p>
